For Challenge #2-VBA


This is the assignment submission for challenge #2- VBA. This script will run through excel file stock listings with a known/set format. The script will run through all the worksheets in open workbooks and extract the ticker name, showing closing vs. opening changes for each, as well as total trade volume. Lastly, it will list the best and worst performing tickers and the one with greatest trade volume. 

Simply copy the VBA script into your excel file and then run it. 

All three of the following are uploaded to GitHub/GitLab:
